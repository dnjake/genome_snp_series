This repro contains a tree of python files that can be used for analysis of thousand genome phase 3 data.
The notebooks provide examples of the analysis.  The analysis depends on data in hdf5 binaries that have
to be included in the directories autosome_snp_data and interval_anal.  The data_preparation sub directories
in each case include the python code that was used to prepare the data.
